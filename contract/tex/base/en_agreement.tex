    to which the Assignor is entitled to receive from the Assignor’s
    Client on the basis of a validly concluded Energy Performance
    Contract (such as defined in the Preamble) and is without
    prejudice to the Forfaiting Assignee’s right to novate of the any
    of the Assignor’s obligations due under the Energy Performance
    Contract. The Receivables subject to their cession to the Facility
    arise from the payment obligations of the following: \par

\item{The Assignor will additionally be entitled to a performance fee
    in respect of each year in which the achieved energy saving under
    the Energy Performance Contract exceeds the amount of the
    guaranteed energy savings for that year pursuant to the Energy
    Performance Contract (after measurement and verification according
    to {{.Contract.Fields.client_name}} Financial and Technical Rules and Guidelines for Energy
    Efficiency Measures). Such performance fee shall be calculated on
    an annual basis pursuant to the following formula: \par

    Consumption. The Assignor shall settle its debt via a transfer to
    a bank account designated by the Forfaiting Assignee within the
    aforementioned term. Failure to ensure timely payment of the above
    entitles the Forfaiting Assignee to a late payment fee in the

      Receivables on the basis of this Agreement which notification
      shall be in the format provided for in Annex No. 1.}

  \item{The Assignor warrants the amount of the Guaranteed Energy
      Savings outlined in the Energy Performance Contract and
      undertakes to maintain its level for the entire duration of the
      Energy Performance Contract, committing to perform all dared
      additional works necessary to keep the Guarantee Energy Savings
      without the need to incur into additional expenses.}

  \item{The Assignor shall ensure that all utility services from and
      to the separate apartments of the Building from where the
      Receivables stem are not disconnected or disrupted at any time
      without the Assignor Client’s prior consent (including when such
      consent is expressed verbally, in writing or communicated via
      e{-}mail to the Manager) and are promptly reinstated in case of
      their temporary non{-}functionality for reasons of regular
      check{-}ups of any nature or repair or replacement in case of
      defect or deficiency. This warranty does not cover cases when
      such disruptions are beyond the Assignor’s control and/or are
      due to acts or omissions by direct suppliers, the Forfaiting
      Assignee or any third parties.}

  \item{The Assignor warrants as at the delivery of the notice for the
      transfer of the Receivables from the Assignor to the Forfaiting
      Assignee that the execution and implementation of all Renovation

      high quality and ware implemented with all necessary tools,
      materials and equipment of suitable nature, quality and
      quantities and are without deficiencies and defects throughout

      and tier). Notwithstanding the above, the Assignor is obliged to
      maintain and ensure the Renovation Works at all times for the
      entire duration of the Energy Performance Contract.}

  \item{The Assignor warrants that all Renovation Works have been
      developed in line with {{index .Contract.Fields "client_name"}} Financial and Technical Rules and
      Guidelines for Energy Efficiency Measures. Additionally the
      Assignor warrants that all Renovation Works have been developed
      taking into account the European and national best practices
      complying with the Investor Confidence Project Europe (ICPEU {-}

      deficiency in the implemented Renovation Works or works
      occurring during the term of this Agreement to undertake repair
      and/or replace at its own cost within a reasonable period of
      time as per applicable industry standards. Failure of the
      Assignor to comply with the above within a reasonable period of
      time, but no longer than within 20 working days, entitles the
      Forfaiting Assignee to execute the work at the expense of the
      Assignor and receive a reimbursement within 20 days as of the
      receipt of the respective invoice sent to the Assignor (which
      may be sent via e{-}mail).}

      of the Energy Consumption expected by the Assignor in that
      period.}

  \item{The Assignor hereby agrees that pursuant to this Agreement the
      Forfaiting Assignee is duly assigned and entitled to collect,

      this effect. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the
      above, any of the personal data or the data related to the
      Building or the Facilities remain property of the Assignor's
      Client without prejudice to the right of the Forfaiting Assignee
      to collect, process, store, use and transfer it and shall be

      from the Assignor examine the latter to determine whether they
      constitute the required documents and promptly, but in any event
      within 10 (ten) working days, return to the Assignor any
      document that does not appear to be satisfactory in terms of its
      authenticity and/or does not appear to create a valid, legal,
      binding or enforceable obligation. If based on the above
      factors, the Forfaiting Assignee determines that the documents
      delivered are not satisfactory or that additional documents are
      required, the Forfaiting Assignee shall notify the Assignor
      thereof in writing by listing its concerns. Where the Assignor
      does not agree with the concerns raised by the Forfaiting
      Assignee, the dispute shall be adjudicated by a reputable
      professional with sufficient international expertise and
      substantial exposure in the field of finance, appointed jointly
      by the Parties and whose decision shall be final, binding and
      effective forthwith. Failure of the Parties to agree on a
      professional to resolve the dispute, shall entitle each Party to
      nominate one expert professional and both such professionals
      shall jointly choose a third professional to chair the
      panel. The decision of the panel shall be binding and the
      Parties shall split the costs for administering the above
      procedure.}

  \item{Save as provided below and in art. 10 of the General Terms and
      Conditions, the Forfaiting Assignee shall have no recourse to
      the Assignor for the non{-}payment of the Receivables unless:}

      is entitled to indemnity under this Agreement, such Indemnified
      Party shall promptly notify the other Party (the “Indemnifying
      Party“) in writing of such action or demand. The Party that has
      assumed the defence of such action shall provide the other Party

      or adjustment without the other Party's consent, which: (i) in
      the case of the Indemnifying Party, shall not be unreasonably
      withheld if the settlement or adjustment is limited to payment
      of monetary damages; (ii) in the case of the Indemnified Party,
      may be withheld for any reason if the settlement or adjustment

      before the enforcement of an indemnity right, stemming from this
      Agreement. }

      request and receive novation of some of the Assignor’s
      obligations under the Energy Performance Contract immediately
      but not later than within five Business days from receipt of the
      respective notification by the Assignor, receive in due time all

      are ceded, has the right to initiate any judicial or
      non{-}judicial measures that are necessary for collecting,
      enforcing and receiving the Receivables. If the Forfaiting
      Assignee has to enforce its rights, it will inform the Assignor
      and the Assignor will co{-}operate as necessary. The Forfaiting
      Assignee will supply to the Assignor any written declaration of
      intent or written statements, which will support or are
      necessary for enforcement and the Assignor will execute the same
      as may be required to give effect to the proposed enforcement.}

      Parties }

  \item{The Assignor shall unilaterally terminate this Agreement by
      notifying the Forfaiting Assignee and the Manager thereof in
      writing at least 30 (thirty) days in advance, if the Assignor’s
      Client has terminated the Energy Performance Contract
      irrespective of the reason thereof. In such case, the Forfaiting
      Assignee shall be entitled to receive as compensation from the
      Assignor an amount equal to the sum of: }

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item{all the remaining future payments from the date of
        termination of the Energy Performance Contract plus the
        statutory interest that would have accrued thereon from the

      Forfaiting Assignee may have incurred and the planned amount of
      income which the Assignee would have received if the Energy
      Performance Contract had not been terminated, but without double
      counting.}

  \item{The Agreement shall not be terminated before the termination
      of the Energy Performance Contract, unless the Assignor and the
      Forfaiting Assignee have agreed in writing on other terms or the
      Agreement provides otherwise.  }

  \item{Termination of this Agreement does not release the Parties
      from fulfilment of their respective obligations set forth in

      termination of this Agreement, unless the Parties have agreed in
      writing on other provisions or this Agreement provides
      otherwise}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item{the Forfaiting Assignee shall be entitled to receive any
        amount payable by the Assignor's Client under the terms of the
        Energy Performance Contract as a result of such termination
        (and such amounts shall form part of the Receivables); }

    \item{subject to the terms of the Energy Performance Contract, if
        the Building will not suffer any material damage from such
        dismantling or absence of any of the Facilities installed by
        the Assignor, the Forfaiting Assignee is entitled to dismantle
        the Facilities in the Building owned by the Assignor and

        to the Forfaiting Assignee such amount as shall, together with
        any other amounts received under this art. 5.6, be equal to
        the amount that the Forfaiting Assignee would be entitled to
        receive under art. 5.3 if the Assignor had terminated this
        Agreement. The above is without prejudice to the Assignor’s

      provisions with an insurer rated minimum A+ according to
      relevant reputable ratings applicable to Latvia. The Assignor
      shall deliver to the Forfaiting Assignee the original of such
      insurance policy or submit a certified copy of the policy or

      the insurance premium. Any policy naming the Assignor as a
      beneficiary under the insurance coverage shall be duly
      transferred in the applicable and legally binding way to the
      Forfaiting Assignee thus rendering the latter as an ultimate
      beneficiary under the insurance policy.}

  \item{Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Forfaiting
      Assignee is entitled at its own expense to additionally insure
      the Building, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Measures, the

      transferred by the Assignee (which assignment or transfer may be
      made by several assignments, each in respect of the Receivables

      transfer may take the form of the ceding to any third party of
      the Receivables being forfaited under this Agreement. }
